# Captures Windows host

The Windows replacement for the egui/wgpu workbench: Win32 windows,
DirectComposition, Direct2D, DirectWrite (system Segoe UI Variable) and UI
Automation, with Captures' own token-drawn controls. See
[native-rewrite.md](../../../docs/native-rewrite.md#host-direction) for the
direction and the gates it must pass. It has Preferences (every shipping
card with the Custom accent's color editor, the narrow layout below 720 px,
and Find on a reusable text field, `src/textfield.rs`), Capture History
(`--scene history`) and a first screenshot editor slice, opened by History's
Edit or `--scene editor --artifact ID` (`src/editor.rs`).

```powershell
node apps/native/prepare.mjs --output apps/native/windows/resources
cargo +1.95.0 run --manifest-path apps/native/windows/Cargo.toml -- `
  --profile $env:TEMP\captures-windows
```

Run it against a disposable profile, never your real settings or folders:
`--profile DIR` (or `CAPTURES_NATIVE_PROFILE=DIR`) keeps settings in
`DIR\settings.json`, history in `DIR\history` and a new profile's saves in
`DIR\Captures`, and never writes the launch-at-login Run key. It replaces
`--settings-file` and `--history-root`, which remain for CI and fixtures.

`--history-root DIR` enables Start Captures on login for that development
profile. `--appearance light|dark`, `--size WxH` and `--screenshot out.png`
render one frame offscreen (Direct2D bitmap, WIC PNG) and exit, for parity
comparisons; `--find QUERY` renders it with Find open and the query typed. On other platforms the binary is a stub, so `cargo check` and
`clippy` still run; cross-check with `--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

Each scene node (`src/scene.rs`) owns one composition surface. Hover and
toggle transitions animate visual opacity and offsets on the compositor, and
scrolling moves the card column's visual, so a frame redraws only nodes whose
content changed (on hover, at most one 32×19 switch track).
